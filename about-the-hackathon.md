# NCFunder hackathon -- promoting access to capital for *everyone* 

by Nina Kilbride

## This repository is a legal engineering toolkit


This repo collects various legal, tech systemic and other information on how to identify and develop community-based solutions using blockchain. It does not give a complete result, rather, it collects information about those things that are common needs among all entities in the North Carolina crowdfunding ecosystem. 


As we develop a usable way to deliver applied blockchain solutions, we are also creating a model for other Legal Hackers to follow. 


The contents of this repository are what our group collected and created over the course of a month investigating how to make crowdfunding and blockchain work in local symbiosis. 


## North Carolina is the bomb!


*Research Triangle Park* is a good place to commercialize blockchain solutions for a number of reasons:

- emerging tech innovation track record
- tech-educated workforce
- access to subject matter experts in multiple verticals 
- growing economy
- large “feedstock” for new companies that will commercialize transformative applied solutions combining blockchain and other emerging tech tools


#### The backstory 


I have had a bee in my bonnet about intrastate crowdfunding and blockchain since before I left law practice to become a "legal engineer." In 2017, blockchain and crowdfunding became increasingly relevant in North Carolina. North Carolina became the first state to enact SEC Exemption 147A. Blockchain companies discovered that North Carolina has the secret sauce to emerging tech commercialization, and began to hire workers here. However, the benefits of blockchain technology have not connected with local opportunities.

- I'm not talking about coin offerings or token sales. 
- I'm talking about *legal operations*, tech solutions that make local potential for blockchain scalable. 
- I'm talking about automating the processes and aggregating the data that keeps capital from flowing to main street, unblocking the system, both in traditional markets and in cryptocurrencies. 


Despite NC PACES Act enabling rules in April 2017 to bring SEC 147A functionality to life, there existed many barriers to use of the new rule. First were the limitations put in place at the state level. Fundraising limits are low. This low dollar amount means less ROI for a fairly complex process. Carve-outs prevent crowdfunding in some high-value verticals, creating further disincentives. These regulatory issues are outside the scope of the hackathon. 

What we can fix: there exist few data aggregation tools that make an inexpensive, automated process feasible. A cheap, reliable tool should have the effect of opening up the ecosystem to new kinds of investments. 


### Crowdfunding: a necessary first step

Crowdfunding is the underlying dependency for the majority of long-tail, inclusive blockchain use cases. Blockchain empowered inexpensive, portable data aggregation tools to support financial services for populations previously excluded from the economy because they could not get a bank account or access growth capital. (See BanQu as early success providing services to the unbanked). In the United States, the issue is multifaceted. Sophisticated tools exist but are out of reach for most of the market. These tools, especially data aggregation tools, are not available to the majority of the market. This means missed opportunity for growth for the entire economy. Intrastate crowdfunding is an attempt by the US to bring new financial services and capital access to small businesses and entrepreneurs. 

Blockchain is a crowdfunding liquidity machine. Recent crowdfunding raises by blockchain based companies show that it is possible to harness financial technology to provide inexpensive, quick liquidity to startup businesses. However, lack of regulatory tools mean that blockchain based crowdfunding is currently risky and of limited utility for small businesses. 

*NCFunder.com* is a nonprofit dedicated to bringing the tools of financial technology to community development, small businesses and social entrepreneurs. Beginning in 2018, NCFunder will operate a NCFunding Portal that features transformative social entrepreneurship as well as tools to help founders and operators of crowdfunded entities succeed.  

*Legal tools.* Part of the problem in lack of access to capital is lack of access to legal tools for small and startup businesses. Y-Combinator addressed this issue by creating a set of uniform startup documents that supported venture capital investor needs, SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity). The SAFE documents stimulated the market for startups by making it easier to set up a bankable company. SAFE documents have been modified for the blockchain space as SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens). This functionality will also support intrastate crowdfunding, with documents tailored to individual states’ securities laws. By careful state-by-state articulation, it is possible to create a multi-jurisdiction, networked model for aggregating intrastate crowdfunding. This is a logical structure in a federal system, comparable to voting. 

North Carolina has a strategic advantage in that it was the first adopter of SEC Exemption 147A, which loosened the restrictions on internet advertising for crowdfunding. However, North Carolina enacted its exemption NC PACES, with significant limitations on fundraising amount and on revenue for funding portals. The solution to generating value on this set of facts is NCFunder. 

*Long term outcome of NCFunder is to contribute to the global effort to bring down the marginal cost of financial services for small and medium enterprises and bring diversity to markets.*  SMEs comprise 80% of the global market, and their finance needs are largely unmet.

#### Define desired outcome: stimulate crowdfunding+blockchain in North Carolina.   	


This is a pretty lofty goal, so it's important to focus on what this "hackathon" is going to do. Hackathons are new to Southern lawyers, and most models online tend to advise about holding a hackathon as a conference rather than as a low-cost way to achieve a community result. That wasn't what our team of was into. We needed a way to "hack like cockroaches" in order for it to be sustainable and repeatable by others. 


**Looks like a job for Legal Hackers!** 


I contacted Dazza Greenwood of MIT Media Lab, who advised me to find my local resources and ask them to help me. I was skeptical. "Easy for you to say, Dazza," I replied. "This is not MIT or NYC." 

No, it's not. It's Research Triangle Park, and it hosts a tremendous number of smart people who know how to get things done. Dazza brought some of them to my attention, particularly our Code4America groups, which operate regular Civic Hacking Meetup groups. Here, things get done, with a little less hoopla and a little more focus on the work. I gathered up a team of lawyer-tech-problem-solvers willing to help me, including Molly Hanes, Jason Cross, David Chambers and Stephen Palley.


Code4America and Legal Hackers both offer some frameworks for putting together a work plan for a hackathon. (links) These served as great inspiration for our team in "how to" put together our work product outcome.


I attended events in Durham and in Raleigh. In Durham, there's a biweekly CodeforDurham meetup with pizza. http://codefordurham.com/ Friendly folks, and everyone has their laptop out. The first night I went I just observed and met. The next time, I reserved a little time to share NCFunder's work with their crowd. Donations are accepted for operational expense like pizza. 

CityCampNC in Raleigh was a much bigger production. http://citycampnc.org/code-sprint-2016/ Tickets were $25, and there were speeches in addition to hacking. For the hackathon, teams were divided into problems that they work on over several weeks in a sprint. The problems were set up with repositories and finite coding tasks in advance and for incremental solutions building. See examples: http://citycampnc.org/code-sprint-2016/ https://github.com/CodeForNC/reentry-project-center 


One thing I learned from the hackers at Code4Durham and CityCamp was that I needed to make sure that I brought them an actionable problem for a developer, not a lawyer. I needed to work on the actionable legal problems myself and bring as complete a tech roadmap to community hacking as possible.  During the time we devoted to the NCFunder hackathon, we focused on adding to it those things we were particularly well suited to doing ourselves, in order to get the ball rolling. CityCampNC offers opportunity to pitch solutions to the hackathon and bring their civic solutions to life.  


#### Refine desired outcome: specific outputs, specific times. 


Refining the output for our hackathon meant scoping a digestible bit during the short time we allotted ourselves. In the hackathon period of 4.5 weeks, it seemed possible to produce the following: 


- Open-source repo devoted to crowdfunding + blockchain utilities
- First-person discussion of how to approach a legal hacking problem
- Legal research resources to get lawyers, businesspeople, investors and developers on same page
- Machine readable NC crowdfunding legal exemplar forms
- Draft whitepaper on legal+policy reasons for intrastate blockchain crowdfunding 
- Tech exemplars
- User Stories and Roles 


#### Scope: focus on smart contract functionality, not specific blockchain platform 


This hackathon does not extend to choice of technological platforms. Instead, it serves as an orientation for lawyers and gives a set of functionalities and specifications. We anticipate that users will have different needs for the tools in real life, and that they may wish to execute a project on Ethereum, Hyperledger, Bitcoin, another platform, or all of them. Our goal was to produce something useful for all those applications. 


#### Necessary functionality


We want the equivalent of an invest now button that folks can put on their website then tools that can

- NICE TO HAVE: provide access to disclosures (or that happens on issuer website)
- NICE TO HAVE: create a platform for discussion (this is NCPO but not bad for LPOs)
- Must intake investor identification info (name, age, address, ss#, status as Accredited investor)
- Must confirm that above is accurate (AML/KYC) 
- Must allow investors to commit/pledge $ to invest
- Must implement offering caps (for non-AI)
- Must provide process to withdraw
- Must allow investors to sync bank account for ACH transfer to Escrow Agent's bank account
- Must accept electronic signatures to subscription and transaction documents
- Must permit issuers to review information and determine whether to accept investments from each investor
- Must communicate with investors about process and provide notices about


#### *Making it useful* meant pre-engineering to the point where most users have the same needs
