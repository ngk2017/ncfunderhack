Re: Intrastate crowdfunding opportunity or
“Jurisdiction-sensitive entitlement interest widget.” 

TLDR: The law in NC changed to enable a Local Public Offering via the internet of UCC Article 8 Security. The legal framework exists to operate UCC Article 8 securities in nearly every state, but they were preempted by US securities law since 1933. New crowdfunding models mean Article 8 Securities, and the corresponding legal frameworks, are relevant again, but there are no serious preexisting legal actors in the space. IBM wants to promote NC startups and wants to do a project with us. This one is a good fit. The Secretary of State promised press coverage when the models go live.  Large potential network effects in startups, small business and token community.

			Not very liquid once the stock has been made. This creates a market barrier for traditional investment. The crowdfunding ecosystem has to operate lean in order to operate sustainably. 
			
			
Deep analysis of why the lack of tech tools to support crowdfunding are a high-impact project. NGK will dump a lot of links + argument flow

More detailed discussion of crowdfunding TBD - what do we want to make sure to flesh out?. At a minimum
		JOBS Act
		SEC 147
		SEC 147A
			North Carolina (deeper dive than other two)
Georgia - focus on distinctions
Ohio - short persuasive statement 


Systemic Analysis (need diagrams here)
Many functional problems with crowdfunding stem from compliance burden in a market that already has higher borrowing costs. A tool that brings these costs down will create a nonzero sum solution that (cite MIT desirables from Aug 2017)

SME Finance is enabled by blockchain.

Asset vaulting (especially invoices and other trade receivables), is a key to opening up small business finance needs. Before blockchain, vaulting and perfection rules were prohibitively expensive for SME to fix their assets for easily lending. Blockchain plus fintech will address this shortfall, meeting a manifest need the incumbents ignore. 

Globally, 80% of SME finance is unmet. McKinsey estimates the unmet annual need is $2.1T in emerging markets.http://mckinseyonsociety.com/two-trillion-and-counting/

Women are the entry into this market. Women face traditional hurdles to accessing business financing at a greater rate than men.
