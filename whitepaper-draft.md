Deep analysis of why the lack of tech tools to support crowdfunding are a high-impact project. NGK will dump a lot of links + argument flow

Georgia - focus on distinctions
Ohio - short persuasive statement 


Systemic Analysis (need diagrams here)
Many functional problems with crowdfunding stem from compliance burden in a market that already has higher borrowing costs. A tool that brings these costs down will create a nonzero sum solution that (cite MIT desirables from Aug 2017)

Plan of work


Diversified small business finance is enabled by blockchain.

Asset vaulting (especially invoices and other trade receivables), is a key to opening up small business finance needs. Before blockchain, vaulting and perfection rules were prohibitively expensive for SME to fix their assets for easily lending. Blockchain plus fintech will address this shortfall, meeting a manifest need the incumbents ignore. 

Globally, 80% of SME finance is unmet. McKinsey estimates the unmet annual need is $2.1T in emerging markets.http://mckinseyonsociety.com/two-trillion-and-counting/

Women are the entry into this market. Women face traditional hurdles to accessing business financing at a greater rate than men.
